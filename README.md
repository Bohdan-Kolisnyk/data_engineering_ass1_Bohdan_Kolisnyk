# 📘 Student Assignment: Working with Nested JSON Data

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice working with **semi-structured JSON data**, transform it into a **structured format**, and perform **analytical queries using window functions** to extract meaningful insights.

---

## Task Description

### 1. Dataset Selection

* Find a dataset that:

    * Is stored in **JSON format**
    * Contains a **nested structure** (e.g. arrays, nested objects). The dataset must contain **both nested data and arrays.**
    * Has a size of **more than 10 MB**
* You may use:

    * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
    * Open data portals
    * Any other publicly available source

Examples of nested JSON structures:

* Arrays of objects
* Objects inside objects

---

### 2. Data Loading

* Load the dataset into an analytical environment.
* You may use:

    * DuckDB
    * BigQuery
    * Any other analytical database system that supports JSON

---

### 3. Data Parsing (Mandatory)

* Transform semi-structured JSON data into a **structured format** (tables with columns).
* This includes:

    * Flattening(unnest) arrays
    * Extracting nested fields
    * Casting data types where needed

The final result should be queryable using SQL.

---

### 4. Data Analysis Using Window Functions (Mandatory)

* Use **SQL window functions** to analyze the dataset.
* Provide **at least 2 data insights**.

Examples of insights:

* Top 3 companies by revenue per region
* Ranking users by activity within categories
* Running totals or moving averages over time
* Percentage contribution within a group

Each insight should include:

* SQL query
* Short explanation of the result

---

## Deliverables

* `README.md` (this file, extended with your work)
* SQL scripts or notebooks used for:

    * Loading data
    * Parsing JSON
    * Analysis
* Post it all on your GitHub and add a link to GitHub in Moodle.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Obligatory Part — **10 points**

| Criteria                                   | Points |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Dataset > 10 MB with nested JSON structure | 1      |
| Correct data loading                       | 1      |
| Proper parsing of semi-structured data     | 2      |
| Use of window functions                    | 2      |
| At least 2 meaningful data insights        | 2      |
| Knowledge of theory*                       | 2      |
| **Total**                                  | **10** |

_*The Theoretical Questions section will help you prepare for the defense of your theoretical knowledge. The teacher has the right to rephrase the theoretical questions._


### Additional Task — **+2.5 points (Optional)**

Choose **one** of the following:

* Add **data quality checks** (nulls, duplicates, schema validation)
* Visualize results (charts or dashboards)

Clearly document the additional work in the README.

---

## Notes

* SQL clarity and readability matter.
* Reproducibility is important.
* Insights should be logical and data-driven, not trivial aggregations.

---

Below is a **ready-to-add section** for your `README.md`.

## 📚 Theoretical Questions

Answer the following **10 theoretical questions**. Answers should be concise, technically correct, and supported by examples where appropriate.

1. **Big Data vs Traditional Data Processing**
   Explain how Big Data differs from traditional data processing systems. Why do data volume, velocity, and distribution fundamentally change system design?

2. **The 5Vs of Big Data**
   Interpret the 5Vs (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value). Explain how each V impacts data ingestion, storage, processing, and analytics.

3. **Data Variety and Schema Design**
   Explain how data variety affects schema design. Why are schema-on-read approaches often used for semi-structured and unstructured data?

4. **Data Types Classification**
   Classify data into structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Provide examples of each and explain how they are typically stored and processed.

5. **Processing Semi-Structured Data**
   Describe common techniques for processing semi-structured data (e.g. JSON, Avro, Parquet). How do analytical databases handle nested data?

6. **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**
   Describe MPP architectures. How do they distribute data and parallelize computation? What are the benefits and challenges of this approach?

7. **OLTP vs OLAP Systems**
    Differentiate OLTP and OLAP workloads in terms of:

    * Query patterns
    * Typical technologies used
    * Data storing

Good luck!




##Short decription of what was done:
Dataset chosen: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv/data
It contains nested structures in "versions" and "update_date"
About the code:
Data was uploaded and quality checked(nulls=0, duplicates by id = 26, and for schema validation articles without authors = 0)
Parsing: unnested the versions array and parsed nested date fields
Insights analyzed:
1. Most active research categories by total paper submissions(top1 - hep-ph)
2. Shift towards larger research teams(3-year MA of author qty)(res: from 1.96 to 5.19 change)
3. Each category research trends(YoY growth rates) (top1 - 2020(year), eess.AS(category), 1988(papers qty), 152.28(growth %)
